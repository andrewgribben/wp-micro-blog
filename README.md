# wp-micro-blog

Couple of WordPress tweaks for Manton Reece's "micro.blog":

1. Hide Title from "Add new/Edit Post" screen (but actually make it a date)

1. Use custom RSS feed that doesn't have titles

Caveat: this is for my WordPress site which *only* exists to feed micro.blog – there's no other content.
